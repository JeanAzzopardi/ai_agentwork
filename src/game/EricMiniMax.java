/*
 * A one-step look-ahead agent will try each of the possible moves using,
 * a model of the environment - in this case the Board that has been provided,
 * to you as the percept - and evaluate the resulting positions to select the,
 * most promising one. 
 * This evaluation function is an example of a utility function,
 * (hence this is a simple utility-based agent).
 * 
 * For example, one simple strategy would be to move to a position that,
 * minimises the number of options available to your opponent. 
 * In this case the utility function might be the negation of the number,
 * of moves available to the opponent (so that fewer moves gives a higher value).
 * 
 * Implement an agent with this evaluation function. You can do this by,
 * using the Board as your implementation of State - cloning a new copy,
 * of the Board for each available move (so you don't change the actual game), 
 * and trying the move out by passing it the cloned board's update function. 
 * The resulting position can be examined in an implementation of NodeInfo.
 * 
 * Try the new agent out against your reflex agent to see if it is more successful. 
 * The extra competency may be more apparent with some board sizes, configurations, 
 * and number of pieces than others, so you may wish to try a few.
 * 
 * What other one-step strategies can you think of? 
 * Note that you have access to the current pieces through board.getRedPieces(),
 * and board.getBlackPieces() methods. 
 * Try to develop the optimal one-step strategy/evalutation function. 
 * Try your proposals out by building a player and playing off against, 
 * the players provided and other student's players and see if they appear,
 * successful.
